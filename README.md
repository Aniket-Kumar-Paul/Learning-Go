Go (or Golang) is a statically typed, compiled programming language created at Google in 2007 and officially released in 2009. It was designed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson—some of the same people behind Unix, UTF-8, and other core tech.

## 🔧 Key Features of Go:
- **Fast compilation**: Think of it like C/C++, but with a super fast compiler.
- **Simplicity**: Minimalist syntax and standard library; it avoids complex features like inheritance or generics (though generics were added in Go 1.18).
- **Built-in concurrency**: Go routines and channels make concurrent programming easier and more scalable.
- **Garbage collected**: You don’t have to manually manage memory like in C/C++.
- **Cross-compilation**: Easily build binaries for multiple operating systems and architectures.

## ⚙️ Popular Uses:
- Backend services and APIs
- Cloud infrastructure tools (like Docker, Kubernetes)
- CLI tools
- Networking tools (web servers, proxies)
